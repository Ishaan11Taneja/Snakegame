🐍 Snake Game — Java Edition
A modern, interactive version of the classic Snake game built entirely using Java and Swing. This solo project demonstrates core Java principles, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), event-driven programming, and real-time GUI development.

🎮 Gameplay Overview
🕹️ Controls: Use arrow keys to navigate the snake

🍎 Objective: Consume apples to grow longer

🚧 Avoid: Collisions with walls or the snake’s own body

🏁 Game Over: On collision, the game ends and prompts a restart

🛠 Tech Stack
Category	Tools/Technologies
Language	Java
GUI	Java Swing, AWT
Concepts	OOP, Event Listeners, Timers

✨ Core Features
🎨 Custom GUI: Built using JFrame, JPanel, and paintComponent()

⌨️ Keyboard Controls: Responsive arrow-key movement via KeyListener

🍏 Random Apple Generation: Apples appear randomly, aligned to grid

📊 Score Tracker: Real-time score updates

❌ Collision Detection: Game ends on wall or self-collision

🔁 Restart Option: Auto-restart prompt with score reset

💡 Key Concepts Demonstrated
🔧 Modular OOP Design: Clean separation of responsibilities (Snake, Apple, GamePanel, etc.)

⚡ Event-Driven Architecture: Real-time interaction using Timer and KeyListener

♻️ Game Loop Management: Smooth updates with consistent frame timing

🧼 Clean Code Practices: Readable, maintainable, and extensible structure

🚀 Planned Enhancements
🎵 Audio Support: Add background music & sound effects

💾 High Score Persistence: Track scores using file I/O or SQLite

🔥 Difficulty Scaling: Speed increases over time

🖼️ Enhanced Visuals: Upgrade to JavaFX for richer UI

🤝 Multiplayer Mode: Local LAN-based multiplayer support
