# 🐍 Snake Game in Java

A modern recreation of the classic Snake Game built using **Java** and **Swing**. This solo project demonstrates fundamental concepts in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **event-driven programming**, and **GUI application development**.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Preview

- Use arrow keys to control the snake.
- Eat the red apples to grow longer.
- Avoid colliding with the walls or yourself.
- The game ends if the snake runs into itself or the wall.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java  
- **GUI:** Java Swing, AWT  
- **Core Concepts:** OOP, Timers, Event Listeners, Key Bindings

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Interactive GUI** using `JFrame`, `JPanel`, and custom `paintComponent()` logic.
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Controls** with `KeyListener` for responsive arrow key input.
- 🍎 **Random Apple Spawning** with grid-aligned placement.
- 📈 **Live Score Tracking** that updates in real time.
- 🧱 **Collision Detection** for walls and self.
- 🔁 **Game Restart Functionality** with score reset and timed restart prompt.

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

- **Object-Oriented Design:** Organized code into modular classes (`GamePanel`, `Snake`, `Apple`, etc.)
- **Event-Driven Programming:** Leveraged listeners for real-time user input.
- **Game Loop Logic:** Used `Timer` to drive smooth animations and game updates.
- **Clean Code Practices:** Focused on readability, reusability, and maintainability.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add background music and sound effects.
- Persistent high-score saving using file I/O or SQLite.
- Difficulty levels (speed increases over time).
- Enhanced animations with JavaFX or canvas rendering.
- Multiplayer support via sockets or LAN.



## 🧠 What I Learned

- Building a full GUI application from scratch in Java.
- Managing game state, rendering logic, and real-time user interactions.
- Structuring clean, modular, and scalable Java codebases.
- Debugging visual issues in event-driven environments.

## 📂 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game-java.git
   cd snake-game-java
````

2. Compile and run:
